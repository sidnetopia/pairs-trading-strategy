Euclidean Distance

normalise prices to 1 for each stock on the first day of the calendar month (by dividing each price by the price at the first day of the month)
sum the squared differences between the prices.

Zero Crossing Counts

In this measure, we are simply counting the number of times in a month the spread crosses the mean after diverging to at least 2 standard deviations.

It is a simple and direct measurement of the kind of time series behaviour we want in a prospective pair.
