The possibility that outliers dominated the factor plots
The inclusion of illiquid stocks in our universe, which we know tend to look better in pairs backtests

Small sample size â€“ only a handful of out of sample years were available

Remove outliers
Filter on pairs where at least one stock is illiquid
Look at risk-adjusted returns as well as mean returns
